# Recursive Component Implementation

## Description
This project aims to create a recursive component with specific functionalities. The component includes a title, a text box, and buttons for adding children and deleting the current level. The title dynamically updates with the count of characters in the text box and the total characters in all child components' text boxes.

## Implementation Details
### Title
The title of the component should display the count of characters in the text box and the total characters in all child components' text boxes.

### Text Box
Each component includes a text box for entering text.

### Add Child Button
Pressing the add child button creates a child component within the current level.

### Delete Element Button
This button deletes the current level. It is not shown for the root component.

### Styling
- Each level is enclosed in a bordered box with spacing between the border and content.
- The number in the title is emphasized, either with bolder text or larger font size.
- Buttons are styled as round buttons with no border.

## Bonus Features (if time permits)
- Support for adding multiple children for a level.
- Alternate background colors (gray and white) for different levels.
- Different colors for add and delete buttons.
- Placeholder text for text boxes.
